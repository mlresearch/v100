title: Optimizing Sequences of Probabilistic Manipulation Skills Learned from Demonstration
abstract: While manipulation skills such as picking, inserting and placing were hard
  coded in classical setups, it is now widely understood that this leads to poor flexibility
  and that more general skill formulations are required to ensure re-usability in
  new scenarios. We thus adopt a skill-centric approach where each skill is learned
  independently under various scenarios but not attached to any specific task. Afterwards,
  complex manipulation tasks can be achieved by composing these skills in sequence
  or parallel. One essential challenge there is to optimize the parameters of each
  skill such that the success rate of the whole task is maximized. Common approaches
  require first a discretization of the state or action space to generate such parameters
  and second a precise simulator to evaluate the performances under different parameters.
  Instead, we propose to learn task-parameterized models of each skill directly from
  few human demonstrations. Such models allow us to infer the success rate of executing
  a skill within a new scenario conveniently, via computing a novel measure of execution
  confidence. This measure encapsulates both the robot state and the workspace configuration.
  Furthermore, we introduce task-parameterized transition skills that change the object
  poses of interest via translation and rotation. We show that such skills can be
  extremely useful for changing skill parameters and thus potentially improving the
  success rate of a given task. The proposed scheme optimizes skill parameters in
  the continuous domain without the need for simulators. We demonstrate the proposed
  approach on a 7 DoF robot arm solving various manipulation tasks.
