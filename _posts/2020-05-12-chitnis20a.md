title: Learning Compact Models for Planning with Exogenous Processes
abstract: We address the problem of approximate model minimization for MDPs in which
  the state is partitioned into endogenous and (much larger) exogenous components.
  An exogenous state variable is one whose dynamics are independent of the agent’s
  actions. We formalize the mask-learning problem, in which the agent must choose
  a subset of exogenous state variables to reason about when planning; doing planning
  in such a reduced state space can often be significantly more efficient than planning
  in the full model. We then explore the various value functions at play within this
  setting, and describe conditions under which a policy for a reduced model will be
  optimal for the full MDP. The analysis leads us to a tractable approximate algorithm
  that draws upon the notion of mutual information among exogenous state variables.
  We validate our approach in simulated robotic manipulation domains where a robot
  is placed in a busy environment, in which there are many other agents also interacting
  with the objects. Visit http://tinyurl.com/chitnis-exogenous for a supplementary
