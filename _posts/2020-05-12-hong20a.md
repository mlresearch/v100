title: Adversarial Active Exploration for Inverse Dynamics Model Learning
abstract: We present an adversarial active exploration for inverse dynamics model
  learning, a simple yet effective learning scheme that incentivizes exploration in
  an environment without any human intervention. Our framework consists of a deep
  reinforcement learning (DRL) agent and an inverse dynamics model contesting with
  each other. The former collects training samples for the latter, with an objective
  to maximize the error of the latter. The latter is trained with samples collected
  by the former, and generates rewards for the former when it fails to predict the
  actual action taken by the former. In such a competitive setting, the DRL agent
  learns to generate samples that the inverse dynamics model fails to predict correctly,
  while the inverse dynamics model learns to adapt to the challenging samples. We
  further propose a reward structure that ensures the DRL agent to collect only moderately
  hard samples but not overly hard ones that prevent the inverse model from predicting
  effectively. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on several robotic arm
  and hand manipulation tasks against multiple baseline models. Experimental results
  show that our method is comparable to those directly trained with expert demonstrations,
  and superior to the other baselines even without any human priors.
