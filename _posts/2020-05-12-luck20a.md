title: Data-efficient Co-Adaptation of Morphology and Behaviour with Deep Reinforcement
  Learning
abstract: Humans and animals are capable of quickly learning new behaviours to solve
  new tasks. Yet, we often forget that they also rely on a highly specialized morphology
  that co-adapted with motor control throughout thousands of years. Although compelling,
  the idea of co-adapting morphology and behaviours in robots is often unfeasible
  because of the long manufacturing times, and the need to redesign an appropriate
  controller for each morphology. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatically
  and efficiently co-adapt a robot morphology and its controller. Our approach is
  based on recent advances in deep reinforcement learning, and specifically the soft
  actor critic algorithm. Key to our approach is the possibility of leveraging previously
  tested morphologies and behaviors to estimate the performance of new candidate morphologies.
  As such, we can make full use of the information available for making more informed
  decisions, with the ultimate goal of achieving a more data-efficient co-adaptation
  (i.e., reducing the number of morphologies and behaviors tested). Simulated experiments
  show that our approach requires drastically less design prototypes to find good
  morphology-behaviour combinations, making this method particularly suitable for
  future co-adaptation of robot designs in the real world.
