title: Semi-Supervised Learning of Decision-Making Models for Human-Robot Collaboration
abstract: We consider human-robot collaboration in sequential tasks with known task
  objectives. For interaction planning in this setting, the utility of models for
  decision-making under uncertainty has been demonstrated across domains. However,
  in practice, specifying the model parameters remains challenging, requiring significant
  effort from the robot developer. To alleviate this challenge, we present ADACORL,
  a framework to specify decision-making models and generate robot behavior for interaction.
  Central to our approach are a factored task model and a semi-supervised algorithm
  to learn models of human behavior. We demonstrate that our specification approach,
  despite significantly fewer labels, generates models (and policies) that perform
  equally well or better than models learned with supervised data. By leveraging pre-computed
  performance bounds and an online planner, ADACORL can generate robot behavior for
  collaborative tasks with large state spaces (> 1 million states) and short planning
  times (< 0.5 s).
