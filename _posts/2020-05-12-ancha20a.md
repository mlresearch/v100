title: Combining Deep Learning and Verification for Precise Object Instance Detection
abstract: Deep learning based object detectors often report false positives with very
  high confidence. Although they optimize generic detection performance, such as mean
  average precision (mAP), they are not designed for robustness or verifiability.
  We argue that, if a high confidence detection is made by a robot perception system,
  we would want high certainty that the object has indeed been detected. We present
  a detection system that can verify, with high precision, whether each detection
  of a machine-learning based object detector is correct or not. We present a set
  of verification checks based on a novel approach of using dense pixel correspondences
  between known images of objects and a scene, to verify whether the detections made
  in the scene are correct. We motivate this by developing a theoretical framework
  which proves that under certain assumptions, our proposed method will reject any
  false positives. We show that these tests can improve the overall accuracy of a
  base detector and that accepted examples are highly likely to be correct. This allows
  the detector to operate in a high precision regime, and can thus be used for robotic
  perception systems as a reliable instance detection method. Code is available at
