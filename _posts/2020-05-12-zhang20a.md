title: Asynchronous Methods for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
abstract: 'Significant progress has been made in the area of model-based reinforcement
  learning. State-of-the-art algorithms are now able to match the asymptotic performance
  of model-free methods while being significantly more data efficient. However, this
  success has come at a price: state-of-the-art model-based methods require significant
  computation interleaved with data collection, resulting in run times that take days,
  even if the amount of agent interaction might be just hours or even minutes. When
  considering the goal of learning in real-time on real robots, this means these state-of-the-art
  model-based algorithms still remain impractical. In this work, we propose an asynchronous
  framework for model-based reinforcement learning methods that brings down the run
  time of these algorithms to be just the data collection time. We evaluate our asynchronous
  framework on a range of standard MuJoCo benchmarks. We also evaluate our asynchronous
  framework on three real-world robotic manipulation tasks. We show how asynchronous
  learning not only speeds up learning w.r.t wall-clock time through parallelization,
  but also further reduces the sample complexity of model-based approaches by means
  of improving the exploration and by means of effectively avoiding the policy overfitting
  to the deficiencies of learned dynamics models.'
