title: 'Multi-Frame GAN: Image Enhancement for Stereo Visual Odometry in Low Light'
abstract: We propose the concept of a multi-frame GAN (MFGAN) and demonstrate its
  potential as an image sequence enhancement for stereo visual odometry in low light
  conditions. We base our method on an invertible adversarial network to transfer
  the beneficial features of brightly illuminated scenes to the sequence in poor illumination
  without costly paired datasets. In order to preserve the coherent geometric cues
  for the translated sequence, we present a novel network architecture as well as
  a novel loss term combining temporal and stereo consistencies based on optical flow
  estimation. We demonstrate that the enhanced sequences improve the performance of
  state-of-the-art feature-based and direct stereo visual odometry methods on both
  synthetic and real datasets in challenging illumination. We also show that MFGAN
  outperforms other state-of-the-art image enhancement and style transfer methods
  by a large margin in terms of visual odometry.
