title: 'Relay Policy Learning: Solving Long-Horizon Tasks via Imitation and Reinforcement
  Learning'
abstract: We present relay policy learning, a method for imitation and reinforcement
  learning that can solve multi-stage, long-horizon robotic tasks. This general and
  universally-applicable, two-phase approach consists of an imitation learning stage
  resulting in goal-conditioned hierarchical policies that can be easily improved
  using fine-tuning via reinforcement learning in the subsequent phase. Our method,
  while not necessarily perfect at imitation learning, is very amenable to further
  improvement via environment interaction allowing it to scale to challenging long-horizon
  tasks. In particular, we simplify the long-horizon policy learning problem by using
  a novel data-relabeling algorithm for learning goal-conditioned hierarchical policies,
  where the low-level only acts for a fixed number of steps, regardless of the goal
  achieved. While we rely on demonstration data to bootstrap policy learning, we do
  not assume access to demonstrations of specific tasks. Instead, our approach can
  leverage unstructured and unsegmented demonstrations of semantically meaningful
  behaviors that are not only less burdensome to provide, but also can greatly facilitate
  further improvement using reinforcement learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our method on a number of multi-stage, long-horizon manipulation tasks in a challenging
  kitchen simulation environment.
