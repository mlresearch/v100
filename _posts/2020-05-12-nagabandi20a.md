title: Deep Dynamics Models for Learning Dexterous Manipulation
abstract: 'Dexterous multi-fingered hands can provide robots with the ability to flexibly
  perform a wide range of manipulation skills. However, many of the more complex behaviors
  are also notoriously difficult to control: Performing in-hand object manipulation,
  executing finger gaits to move objects, and exhibiting precise fine motor skills
  such as writing, all require finely balancing contact forces, breaking and reestablishing
  contacts repeatedly, and maintaining control of unactuated objects. Learning-based
  techniques provide the appealing possibility of acquiring these skills directly
  from data, but current learning approaches either require large amounts of data
  and produce task-specific policies, or they have not yet been shown to scale up
  to more complex and realistic tasks requiring fine motor skills. In this work, we
  demonstrate that our method of online planning with deep dynamics models (PDDM)
  addresses both of these limitations; we show that improvements in learned dynamics
  models, together with improvements in on-line model-predictive control, can indeed
  enable efficient and effective learning of flexible contact-rich dexterous manipulation
  skills â€“ and that too, on a 24-DoF anthropomorphic hand in the real world, using
  just 4 hours of purely real-world data to learn to simultaneously coordinate multiple
  free-floating objects. Videos can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/pddm/.'
