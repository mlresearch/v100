title: Discrete Residual Flow for Probabilistic Pedestrian Behavior Prediction
abstract: Self-driving vehicles plan around both static and dynamic objects, applying
  predictive models of behavior to estimate future locations of the objects in the
  environment. However, future behavior is inherently uncertain, and models of motion
  that produce deterministic outputs are limited to short timescales. Particularly
  difficult is the prediction of human behavior. In this work, we propose the discrete
  residual flow network (DRF-NET), a convolutional neural network for human motion
  prediction that captures the uncertainty inherent in long-range motion forecasting.
  In particular, our learned network effectively captures multimodal posteriors over
  future human motion by predicting and updating a discretized distribution over spatial
  locations. We compare our model against several strong competitors and show that
  our model outperforms all baselines.
