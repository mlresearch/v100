title: Kernel Trajectory Maps for Multi-Modal Probabilistic Motion Prediction
abstract: Understanding the dynamics of an environment, such as the movement of humans
  and vehicles, is crucial for agents to achieve long-term autonomy in urban environments.
  This requires the development of methods to capture the multimodal and probabilistic
  nature of motion patterns. We present kernel trajectory maps (KTM) to capture the
  trajectories of movement in an environment. KTMs leverage the expressiveness of
  kernels from non-parametric modelling by projecting input trajectories onto a set
  of representative trajectories, to condition on a sequence of observed waypoint
  coordinates, and predict a multi-modal distribution over possible future trajectories.
  The output is a mixture of continuous stochastic processes, where each realisation
  is a continuous functional trajectory, which can be queried at arbitrarily fine
  time steps.
