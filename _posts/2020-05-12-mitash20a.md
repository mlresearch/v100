title: Scene-level Pose Estimation for Multiple Instances of Densely Packed Objects
abstract: This paper introduces key machine learning operations that allow the realization
  of robust, joint 6D pose estimation of multiple instances of objects either densely
  packed or in unstructured piles from RGB-D data. The first objective is to learn
  semantic and instance-boundary detectors without manual labeling. An adversarial
  training framework in conjunction with physics-based simulation is used to achieve
  detectors that behave similarly in synthetic and real data. Given the stochastic
  output of such detectors, candidates for object poses are sampled.The second objective
  is to automatically learn a single score for each pose candidate that represents
  its quality in terms of explaining the entire scene via a gradient boosted tree.
  The proposed method uses features derived from surface and boundary alignment between
  the observed scene and the object model placed at hypothesized poses. Scene-level,
  multi-instance pose estimation is then achieved by an integer linear programming
  process that selects hypotheses that maximize the sum of the learned individual
  scores, while respecting constraints, such as avoiding collisions. To evaluate this
  method, a dataset of densely packed objects with challenging setups for state-of-the-art
  approaches is collected. Experiments on this dataset and a public one show that
  the method significantly outperforms alternatives in terms of 6D pose accuracy while
  trained only with synthetic datasets.
