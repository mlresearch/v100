title: Learning Decentralized Controllers for Robot Swarms with Graph Neural Networks
abstract: We consider the problem of finding distributed controllers for large networks
  of mobile robots with interacting dynamics and sparsely available communications.
  Our approach is to learn local controllers that require only local information and
  communications at test time by imitating the policy of centralized controllers using
  global information at training time. By extending aggregation graph neural networks
  to time varying signals and time varying network support, we learn a single common
  local controller which exploits information from distant teammates using only local
  communication interchanges. We apply this approach to the problem of flocking to
  demonstrate performance on communication graphs that change as the robots move.
  We examine how a decreasing communication radius and faster velocities increase
  the value of multi-hop information.
