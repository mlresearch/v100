title: Connectivity Guaranteed Multi-robot Navigation via Deep Reinforcement Learning
abstract: This paper considers the multi-robot navigation problem where the geometric
  center of a multi-robot team aims to efficiently reach the waypoint without collisions
  in unknown complex environments while maintaining connectivity during the navigation.
  A novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based approach is proposed to derive end-to-end
  policies for the multi-robot navigation problem. In order to guarantee the connectivity
  during the navigation, a constraint satisfying parametric function (CSPF) is proposed
  to represent the navigation policy. Virtual policy extended environment (VP2E),
  an implementation framework of the CSPF is accompanied so as to make CSPF compatible
  with existing DRL techniques which rely on differentiable parametric functions.
  Both simulations and real-world experiments of a team of 3 holonomic robots are
  conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed DRL-based navigation method.
