title: Teacher algorithms for curriculum learning of Deep RL in continuously parameterized
  environments
abstract: We consider the problem of how a teacher algorithm can enable an unknown
  Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) student to become good at a skill over a wide
  range of diverse environments. To do so, we study how a teacher algorithm can learn
  to generate a learning curriculum, whereby it sequentially samples parameters controlling
  a stochastic procedural generation of environments. Because it does not initially
  know the capacities of its student, a key challenge for the teacher is to discover
  which environments are easy, difficult or unlearnable, and in what order to propose
  them to maximize the efficiency of learning over the learnable ones. To achieve
  this, this problem is transformed into a surrogate continuous bandit problem where
  the teacher samples environments in order to maximize absolute learning progress
  of its student. We present a new algorithm modeling absolute learning progress with
  Gaussian mixture models (ALP-GMM). We also adapt existing algorithms and provide
  a complete study in the context of DRL. Using parameterized variants of the BipedalWalker
  environment, we study their efficiency to personalize a learning curriculum for
  different learners (embodiments), their robustness to the ratio of learnable/unlearnable
  environments, and their scalability to non-linear and high-dimensional parameter
  spaces. Videos and code are available at https://github.com/flowersteam/teachDeepRL.
