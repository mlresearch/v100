title: Learning Parametric Constraints in High Dimensions from Demonstrations
abstract: We present a scalable algorithm for learning parametric constraints in high
  dimensions from safe expert demonstrations. To reduce the ill-posedness of the constraint
  recovery problem, our method uses hit-and-run sampling to generate lower cost, and
  thus unsafe, trajectories. Both safe and unsafe trajectories are used to obtain
  a representation of the unsafe set that is compatible with the data by solving an
  integer program in that representationâ€™s parameter space. Our method can either
  leverage a known parameterization or incrementally grow a parameterization while
  remaining consistent with the data, and we provide theoretical guarantees on the
  conservativeness of the recovered unsafe set. We evaluate our method on high-dimensional
  constraints for high-dimensional systems by learning constraints for 7-DOF arm,
  quadrotor, and planar pushing examples, and show that our method outperforms baseline
  approaches.
