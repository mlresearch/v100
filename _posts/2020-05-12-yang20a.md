title: Data Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Legged Robots
abstract: We present a model-based reinforcement learning framework for robot locomotion
  that achieves walking based on only 4.5 minutes of data collected on a quadruped
  robot. To accurately model the robot’s dynamics over a long horizon, we introduce
  a loss function that tracks the model’s prediction over multiple timesteps. We adapt
  model predictive control to account for planning latency, which allows the learned
  model to be used for real time control. Additionally, to ensure safe exploration
  during model learning, we embed prior knowledge of leg trajectories into the action
  space. The resulting system achieves fast and robust locomotion. Unlike model-free
  methods, which optimize for a particular task, our planner can use the same learned
  dynamics for various tasks, simply by changing the reward function.1 To the best
  of our knowledge, our approach is more than an order of magnitude more sample efficient
  than current model-free methods.
