title: Dynamics Learning with Cascaded Variational Inference for Multi-Step Manipulation
abstract: The fundamental challenge of planning for multi-step manipulation is to
  find effective and plausible action sequences that lead to the task goal. We present
  Cascaded Variational Inference Planner (CAVIN), a model-based method that hierarchically
  generates plans by sampling from latent spaces. To facilitate planning over long
  time horizons, our method learns latent representations that decouple the prediction
  of high-level effects from the generation of low-level motions through cascaded
  variational inference. This enables us to model dynamics at two different levels
  of temporal resolutions for hierarchical planning. We evaluate our approach in three
  multi-step robotic manipulation tasks in cluttered tabletop environments given raw
  visual observations. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
  state-of-the-art model-based approaches by strategically planning for interactions
  with multiple objects. See more details at pair.stanford.edu/cavin
