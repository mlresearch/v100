title: Learning to Map Natural Language Instructions to Physical Quadcopter Control
  using Simulated Flight
abstract: We propose a joint simulation and real-world learning framework for mapping
  navigation instructions and raw first-person observations to continuous control.
  Our model estimates the need for environment exploration, predicts the likelihood
  of visiting environment positions during execution, and controls the agent to both
  explore and visit high-likelihood positions. We introduce Supervised Reinforcement
  Asynchronous Learning (SuReAL). Learning uses both simulation and real environments
  without requiring autonomous flight in the physical environment during training,
  and combines supervised learning for predicting positions to visit and reinforcement
  learning for continuous control. We evaluate our approach on a natural language
  instruction-following task with a physical quadcopter, and demonstrate effective
  execution and exploration behavior.
