title: 'Learning Locomotion Skills for Cassie: Iterative Design and Sim-to-Real'
abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising approach for developing
  legged locomotion skills. However, current work commonly describes DRL as being
  a one-shot process, where the state, action and reward are assumed to be well defined
  and are directly used by an RL algorithm to obtain policies. In this paper, we describe
  and document an iterative design approach, which reflects the multiple design iterations
  of the reward that are often (if not always) needed in practice. Throughout the
  process, transfer learning is achieved via Deterministic Action Stochastic State
  (DASS) tuples, representing the deterministic policy actions associated with states
  visited by the stochastic policy. We demonstrate the transfer of policies learned
  in simulation to the physical robot without dynamics randomization. We also identify
  several key components that are critical for sim-to-real transfer in our setting.
