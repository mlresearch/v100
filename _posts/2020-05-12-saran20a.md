title: Understanding Teacher Gaze Patterns for Robot Learning
abstract: Human gaze is known to be a strong indicator of underlying human intentions
  and goals during manipulation tasks. This work studies gaze patterns of human teachers
  demonstrating tasks to robots and proposes ways in which such patterns can be used
  to enhance robot learning. Using both kinesthetic teaching and video demonstrations,
  we identify novel intention-revealing gaze behaviors during teaching. These prove
  to be informative in a variety of problems ranging from reference frame inference
  to segmentation of multi-step tasks. Based on our findings, we propose two proof-of-concept
  algorithms which show that gaze data can enhance subtask classification for a multi-step
  task up to 6% and reward inference and policy learning for a single-step task up
  to 67%. Our findings provide a foundation for a model of natural human gaze in robot
  learning from demonstration settings and present open problems for utilizing human
  gaze to enhance robot learning.
