title: Bayesian Optimization Meets Riemannian Manifolds in Robot Learning
abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) recently became popular in robotics to optimize
  control parameters and parametric policies in direct reinforcement learning due
  to its data efficiency and gradient-free approach. However, its performance may
  be seriously compromised when the parameter space is high-dimensional. A way to
  tackle this problem is to introduce domain knowledge into the BO framework. We propose
  to exploit the geometry of non-Euclidean parameter spaces, which often arise in
  robotics (e.g. orientation, stiffness matrix). Our approach, built on Riemannian
  manifold theory, allows BO to properly measure similarities in the parameter space
  through geometry-aware kernel functions and to optimize the acquisition function
  on the manifold as an unconstrained problem. We test our approach in several benchmark
  artificial landscapes and using a 7-DOF simulated robot to learn orientation and
  impedance parameters for manipulation skills.
