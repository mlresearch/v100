title: 'Asking Easy Questions: A User-Friendly Approach to Active Reward Learning'
abstract: Robots can learn the right reward function by querying a human expert. Existing
  approaches attempt to choose questions where the robot is most uncertain about the
  human’s response; however, they do not consider how easy it will be for the human
  to answer! In this paper we explore an information gain formulation for optimally
  selecting questions that naturally account for the human’s ability to answer. Our
  approach identifies questions that optimize the trade-off between robot and human
  uncertainty, and determines when these questions become redundant or costly. Simulations
  and a user study show our method not only produces easy questions, but also ultimately
  results in faster reward learning.
