title: Model-based Behavioral Cloning with Future Image Similarity Learning
abstract: We present a visual imitation learning framework that enables learning of
  robot action policies solely based on expert samples without any robot trials. Robot
  exploration and on-policy trials in a real-world environment could often be expensive/dangerous.
  We present a new approach to address this problem by learning a future scene prediction
  model solely on a collection of expert trajectories consisting of unlabeled example
  videos and actions, and by enabling generalized action cloning using future image
  similarity. The robot learns to visually predict the consequences of taking an action,
  and obtains the policy by evaluating how similar the predicted future image is to
  an expert image. We develop a stochastic action-conditioned convolutional autoencoder,
  and present how we take advantage of future images for robot learning. We conduct
  experiments in simulated and real-life environments using a ground mobility robot
  with and without obstacles, and compare our models to multiple baseline methods.
