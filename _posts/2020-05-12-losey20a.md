title: 'Learning from My Partner’s Actions: Roles in Decentralized Robot Teams'
abstract: 'When teams of robots collaborate to complete a task, communication is often
  necessary. Like humans, robot teammates should implicitly communicate through their
  actions: but interpreting our partner’s actions is typically difficult, since a
  given action may have many different underlying reasons. Here we propose an alternate
  approach: instead of not being able to infer whether an action is due to exploration,
  exploitation, or communication, we define separate roles for each agent. Because
  each role defines a distinct reason for acting (e.g., only exploit, only communicate),
  teammates now correctly interpret the meaning behind their partner’s actions. Our
  results suggest that leveraging and alternating roles leads to performance comparable
  to teams that explicitly exchange messages.'
