title: Learning by Cheating
abstract: Vision-based urban driving is hard. The autonomous system needs to learn
  to perceive the world and act in it. We show that this challenging learning problem
  can be simplified by decomposing it into two stages. We first train an agent that
  has access to privileged information. This privileged agent cheats by observing
  the ground-truth layout of the environment and the positions of all traffic participants.
  In the second stage, the privileged agent acts as a teacher that trains a purely
  vision-based sensorimotor agent. The resulting sensorimotor agent does not have
  access to any privileged information and does not cheat. This two-stage training
  procedure is counter-intuitive at first, but has a number of important advantages
  that we analyze and empirically demonstrate. We use the presented approach to train
  a vision-based autonomous driving system that substantially outperforms the state
  of the art on the CARLA benchmark and the recent NoCrash benchmark. Our approach
  achieves, for the first time, 100% success rate on all tasks in the original CARLA
  benchmark, sets a new record on the NoCrash benchmark, and reduces the frequency
  of infractions by an order of magnitude compared to the prior state of the art.
