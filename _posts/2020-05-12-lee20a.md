title: 'To Follow or not to Follow: Selective Imitation Learning from Observations'
abstract: Learning from demonstrations is a useful way to transfer a skill from one
  agent to another. While most imitation learning methods aim to mimic an expert skill
  by following the demonstration step-by-step, imitating every step in the demonstration
  often becomes infeasible when the learner and its environment are different from
  the demonstration. In this paper, we propose a method that can imitate a demonstration
  composed solely of observations, which may not be reproducible with the current
  agent. Our method, dubbed selective imitation learning from observations (SILO),
  selects reachable states in the demonstration and learns how to reach the selected
  states. Our experiments on both simulated and real robot environments show that
  our method reliably performs a new task by following a demonstration. Videos and
  code are available at https://clvrai.com/silo.
