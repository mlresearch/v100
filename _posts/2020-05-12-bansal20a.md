title: Combining Optimal Control and Learning for Visual Navigation in Novel Environments
abstract: Model-based control is a popular paradigm for robot navigation because it
  can leverage a known dynamics model to efficiently plan robust robot trajectories.
  However, it is challenging to use model-based methods in settings where the environment
  is a priori unknown and can only be observed partially through onboard sensors on
  the robot. In this work, we address this short-coming by coupling model-based control
  with learning-based perception. The learning-based perception module produces a
  series of waypoints that guide the robot to the goal via a collision-free path.
  These waypoints are used by a model-based planner to generate a smooth and dynamically
  feasible trajectory that is executed on the physical system using feedback control.
  Our experiments in simulated real-world cluttered environments and on an actual
  ground vehicle demonstrate that the proposed approach can reach goal locations more
  reliably and efficiently in novel environments as compared to purely geometric mapping-based
  or end-to-end learning-based alternatives. Our approach does not rely on detailed
  explicit 3D maps of the environment, works well with low frame rates, and generalizes
  well from simulation to the real world. Videos describing our approach and experiments
  are available on the project website4.
