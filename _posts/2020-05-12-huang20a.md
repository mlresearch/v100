title: Nonverbal Robot Feedback for Human Teachers
abstract: Robots can learn preferences from human demonstrations, but their success
  depends on how informative these demonstrations are. Being informative is unfortunately
  very challenging, because during teaching, people typically get no transparency
  into what the robot already knows or has learned so far. In contrast, human students
  naturally provide a wealth of nonverbal feedback that reveals their level of understanding
  and engagement. In this work, we study how a robot can similarly provide feedback
  that is minimally disruptive, yet gives human teachers a better mental model of
  the robot learner, and thus enables them to teach more effectively. Our idea is
  that at any point, the robot can indicate what it thinks the correct next action
  is, shedding light on its current estimate of the human’s preferences. We analyze
  how useful this feedback is, both in theory and with two user studies—one with a
  virtual character that tests the feedback itself, and one with a PR2 robot that
  uses gaze as the feedback mechanism. We find that feedback can be useful for improving
  both the quality of teaching and teachers’ understanding of the robot’s capability.
