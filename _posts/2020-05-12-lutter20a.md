title: HJB Optimal Feedback Control with Deep Differential Value Functions and Action
  Constraints
abstract: Learning optimal feedback control laws capable of executing optimal trajectories
  is essential for many robotic applications. Such policies can be learned using reinforcement
  learning or planned using optimal control. While reinforcement learning is sample
  inefficient, optimal control only plans an optimal trajectory from a specific starting
  configuration. In this paper we propose HJB control to learn an optimal feedback
  policy rather than a single trajectory using principles from optimal control. By
  exploiting the inherent structure of the robot dynamics and strictly convex action
  cost, we derive principled cost functions such that the optimal policy naturally
  obeys the action limits, is globally optimal and stable on the training domain given
  the optimal value function. The corresponding optimal value function is learned
  end-to-end by embedding a deep differential network in the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellmann
  differential equation and minimizing the error of this equality while simultaneously
  decreasing the discounting from short- to far-sighted to enable the learning. Our
  proposed approach enables us to learn an optimal feedback control law in continuous
  time, that in contrast to existing approaches generates an optimal trajectory from
  any point in state-space without the need of replanning. The resulting approach
  is evaluated on non-linear systems and achieves optimal feedback control, where
  standard optimal control methods require frequent replanning.
