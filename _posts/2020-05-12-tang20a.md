title: Worst Cases Policy Gradients
abstract: Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning have demonstrated the capability
  of learning complex control policies from many types of environment. When learning
  policies for safety critical applications, it is important to be sensitive to risks
  and avoid catastrophic events. Towards this goal, we propose an actor-critic framework
  which models the uncertainty of the future and simultaneously learns a policy based
  on that uncertainty model. Specifically, given a distribution of the future return
  for any state and action, we optimize policies for varying levels of conditional
  Value-at-Risk. The learned policy can map the same state to different actions depending
  on the propensity for risk. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
  the domain of driving simulations, where we learn maneuvers in two scenarios. Our
  learned controller can dynamically select actions along a continuous axis, where
  safe and conservative behaviors are found at one end while riskier behaviors are
  found at the other. Finally, when testing with very different simulation parameters,
  our risk-averse policies generalize significantly better compared to other reinforcement
  learning approaches.
