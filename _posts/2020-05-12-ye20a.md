title: Object-centric Forward Modeling for Model Predictive Control
abstract: We present an approach to learn an object-centric forward model, and show
  that this allows us to plan for sequences of actions to achieve distant desired
  goals. We propose to model a scene as a collection of objects, each with an explicit
  spatial location and implicit visual feature, and learn to model the effects of
  actions using random interaction data. Our model allows capturing the robot-object
  and object-object interactions, and leads to more sample-efficient and accurate
  predictions. We show that this learned model can be leveraged to search for action
  sequences that lead to desired goal configurations, and that in conjunction with
  a learned correction module, this allows for robust closed loop execution. We present
  experiments both in simulation and the real world, and show that our approach improves
  over alternate implicit or pixel-space forward models. Please see our project page
  for result videos.
