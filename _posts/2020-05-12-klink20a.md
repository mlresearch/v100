title: Self-Paced Contextual Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Generalization and adaptation of learned skills to novel situations is a
  core requirement for intelligent autonomous robots. Although contextual reinforcement
  learning provides a principled framework for learning and generalization of behaviors
  across related tasks, it generally relies on uninformed sampling of environments
  from an unknown, uncontrolled context distribution, thus missing the benefits of
  structured, sequential learning. We introduce a novel relative entropy reinforcement
  learning algorithm that gives the agent the freedom to control the intermediate
  task distribution, allowing for its gradual progression towards the target context
  distribution. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed curriculum learning scheme
  drastically improves sample efficiency and enables learning in scenarios with both
  broad and sharp target context distributions in which classical approaches perform
  sub-optimally.
