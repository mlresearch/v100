title: Towards Learning to Detect and Predict Contact Events on Vision-based Tactile
  Sensors
abstract: In essence, successful grasp boils down to correct responses to multiple
  contact events between fingertips and objects. In most scenarios, tactile sensing
  is adequate to distinguish contact events. Due to the nature of high dimensionality
  of tactile information, classifying spatiotemporal tactile signals using conventional
  model-based methods is difficult. In this work, we propose to predict and classify
  tactile signal using deep learning methods, seeking to enhance the adaptability
  of the robotic grasp system to external event changes that may lead to grasping
  failure. We develop a deep learning framework and collect 6650 tactile image sequences
  with a vision-based tactile sensor, and the neural network is integrated into a
  contact-event-based robotic grasping system. In grasping experiments, we achieved
  52% increase in terms of object lifting success rate with contact detection, significantly
  higher robustness under unexpected loads with slip prediction compared with open-loop
  grasps, demonstrating that integration of the proposed framework into robotic grasping
  system substantially improves picking success rate and capability to withstand external
  disturbances.
