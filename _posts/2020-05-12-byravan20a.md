title: 'Imagined Value Gradients: Model-Based Policy Optimization with Tranferable
  Latent Dynamics Models'
abstract: Humans are masters at quickly learning many complex tasks, relying on an
  approximate understanding of the dynamics of their environments. In much the same
  way, we would like our learning agents to quickly adapt to new tasks. In this paper,
  we explore how model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) can facilitate transfer to
  new tasks. We develop an algorithm that learns an action-conditional, predictive
  model of expected future observations, rewards and values from which a policy can
  be derived by following the gradient of the estimated value along imagined trajectories.
  We show how robust policy optimization can be achieved in robot manipulation tasks
  even with approximate models that are learned directly from vision and proprioception.
  We evaluate the efficacy of our approach in a transfer learning scenario, re-using
  previously learned models on tasks with different reward structures and visual distractors,
  and show a significant improvement in learning speed compared to strong off-policy
  baselines. Videos with results can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/ivg-corl19
