title: Predictive Safety Network for Resource-constrained Multi-agent Systems
abstract: Coordinating multiple agents, such as mobile robots, with shared resources,
  such as common battery charging stations, is a highly relevant but still challenging
  decision problem. Traditionally, the motion and task planning of multi-agent systems
  are tackled by either designing ad-hoc decision rules or employing optimization
  tools. The former requires intensive manual tuning while the latter needs a static
  and accurate model of the complete system. Both approaches are prone to uncertainties
  in the robot motion and task execution. In this work, we propose a novel planning
  framework based on recent advances in deep reinforcement learning. The framework
  combines a centralized safety policy that acts on direct predictions of future resource
  levels and a decentralized task policy that optimizes task completions. The safety
  network is trained using supervised learning without extraneous supervision, while
  the task policy is trained using concurrent self-play. The whole framework follows
  a hierarchical structure to avoid the exponential blowup in the state and action
  space. We demonstrate significant improvements in a practical logistic planning
  problem for warehouse robots, compared with heuristic solutions, optimization tools
  and other reinforcement learning methods.
