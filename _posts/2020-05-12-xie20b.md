title: 'The Best of Both Modes: Separately Leveraging RGB and Depth for Unseen Object
  Instance Segmentation'
abstract: In order to function in unstructured environments, robots need the ability
  to recognize unseen novel objects. We take a step in this direction by tackling
  the problem of segmenting unseen object instances in tabletop environments. However,
  the type of large-scale real-world dataset required for this task typically does
  not exist for most robotic settings, which motivates the use of synthetic data.
  We propose a novel method that separately leverages synthetic RGB and synthetic
  depth for unseen object instance segmentation. Our method is comprised of two stages
  where the first stage operates only on depth to produce rough initial masks, and
  the second stage refines these masks with RGB. Surprisingly, our framework is able
  to learn from synthetic RGB-D data where the RGB is non-photorealistic. To train
  our method, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset of random objects on tabletops.
  We show that our method, trained on this dataset, can produce sharp and accurate
  masks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on unseen object instance segmentation.
  We also show that our method can segment unseen objects for robot grasping. Code,
  models and video can be found at the project website1.
