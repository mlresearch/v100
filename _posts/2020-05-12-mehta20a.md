title: Active Domain Randomization
abstract: Domain randomization is a popular technique for improving domain transfer,
  often used in a zero-shot setting when the target domain is unknown or cannot easily
  be used for training. In this work, we empirically examine the effects of domain
  randomization on agent generalization. Our experiments show that domain randomization
  may lead to suboptimal, high-variance policies, which we attribute to the uniform
  sampling of environment parameters. We propose Active Domain Randomization, a novel
  algorithm that learns a parameter sampling strategy. Our method looks for the most
  informative environment variations within the given randomization ranges by leveraging
  the discrepancies of policy rollouts in randomized and reference environment instances.
  We find that training more frequently on these instances leads to better overall
  agent generalization. Our experiments across various physics-based simulated and
  real-robot tasks show that this enhancement leads to more robust, consistent policies.
