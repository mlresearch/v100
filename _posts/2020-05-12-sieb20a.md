title: Graph-Structured Visual Imitation
abstract: We cast visual imitation as a visual correspondence problem. Our robotic
  agent is rewarded when its actions result in better matching of relative spatial
  configurations for corresponding visual entities detected in its workspace and the
  teacherâ€™s demonstration. We build upon recent advances in Computer Vision, such
  as human finger keypoint detectors, object detectors trained on-the-fly with synthetic
  augmentations, and point detectors supervised by viewpoint changes [1] and learn
  multiple visual entity detectors for each demonstration without human annotations
  or robot interactions. We empirically show that the proposed factorized visual representations
  of entities and their spatial arrangements drive successful imitation of a variety
  of manipulation skills within minutes, using a single demonstration and without
  any environment instrumentation. It is robust to background clutter and can effectively
  generalize across environment variations between demonstrator and imitator, greatly
  outperforming unstructured non-factorized full-frame CNN encodings of previous works
  [2].
