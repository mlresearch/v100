title: Variational Inference MPC for Bayesian Model-based Reinforcement Learning
abstract: 'In recent studies on model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), incorporating
  uncertainty in forward dynamics is a state-of-the-art strategy to enhance learning
  performance, making MBRLs competitive to cutting-edge modelfree methods, especially
  in simulated robotics tasks. Probabilistic ensembles with trajectory sampling (PETS)
  is a leading type of MBRL, which employs Bayesian inference to dynamics modeling
  and model predictive control (MPC) with stochastic optimization via the cross entropy
  method (CEM). In this paper, we propose a novel extension to the uncertainty-aware
  MBRL. Our main contributions are twofold: Firstly, we introduce a variational inference
  MPC (VI-MPC), which reformulates various stochastic methods, including CEM, in a
  Bayesian fashion. Secondly, we propose a novel instance of the framework, called
  probabilistic action ensembles with trajectory sampling (PaETS). As a result, our
  Bayesian MBRL can involve multimodal uncertainties both in dynamics and optimal
  trajectories. In comparison to PETS, our method consistently improves asymptotic
  performance on several challenging locomotion tasks.'
