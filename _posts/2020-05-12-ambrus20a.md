title: Two Stream Networks for Self-Supervised Ego-Motion Estimation
abstract: Learning depth and camera ego-motion from raw unlabeled RGB video streams
  is seeing exciting progress through self-supervision from strong geometric cues.
  To leverage not only appearance but also scene geometry, we propose a novel self-supervised
  two-stream network using RGB and inferred depth information for accurate visual
  odometry. In addition, we introduce a sparsity-inducing data augmentation policy
  for ego-motion learning that effectively regularizes the pose network to enable
  stronger generalization performance. As a result, we show that our proposed two-stream
  pose network achieves state-of-the-art results among learning-based methods on the
  KITTI odometry benchmark, and is especially suited for self-supervision at scale.
  Our experiments on a large-scale urban driving dataset of 1 million frames indicate
  that the performance of our proposed architecture does indeed scale progressively
  with more data.
