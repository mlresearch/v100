title: Learning value functions with relational state representations for guiding
  task-and-motion planning
abstract: We propose a novel relational state representation and an action-value function
  learning algorithm that learns from planning experience for geometric task-and-motion
  planning (GTAMP) problems, in which the goal is to move several objects to regions
  in the presence of movable obstacles. The representation encodes information about
  which objects occlude the manipulation of other objects and is encoded using a small
  set of predicates. It supports efficient learning, using graph neural networks,
  of an action-value function that can be used to guide a GTAMP solver. Importantly,
  it enables learning from planning experience on simple problems and generalizing
  to more complex problems and even across substantially different geometric environments.
  We demonstrate the method in two challenging GTAMP domains.
