title: Disentangled Relational Representations for Explaining and Learning from Demonstration
abstract: Learning from demonstration is an effective method for human users to instruct
  desired robot behaviour. However, for most non-trivial tasks of practical interest,
  efficient learning from demonstration depends crucially on inductive bias in the
  chosen structure for rewards/costs and policies. We address the case where this
  inductive bias comes from an exchange with a human user. We propose a method in
  which a learning agent utilizes the information bottleneck layer of a high-parameter
  variational neural model, with auxiliary loss terms, in order to ground abstract
  concepts such as spatial relations. The concepts are referred to in natural language
  instructions and are manifested in the high-dimensional sensory input stream the
  agent receives from the world. We evaluate the properties of the latent space of
  the learned model in a photorealistic synthetic environment and particularly focus
  on examining its usability for downstream tasks. Additionally, through a series
  of controlled table-top manipulation experiments, we demonstrate that the learned
  manifold can be used to ground demonstrations as symbolic plans, which can then
  be executed on a PR2 robot.
