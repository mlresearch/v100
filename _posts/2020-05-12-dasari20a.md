title: 'RoboNet: Large-Scale Multi-Robot Learning'
abstract: 'Robot learning has emerged as a promising tool for taming the complexity
  and diversity of the real world. Methods based on high-capacity models, such as
  deep networks, hold the promise of providing effective generalization to a wide
  range of open-world environments. However, these same methods typically require
  large amounts of diverse training data to generalize effectively. In contrast, most
  robotic learning experiments are small-scale, single-domain, and single-robot. This
  leads to a frequent tension in robotic learning: how can we learn generalizable
  robotic controllers without having to collect impractically large amounts of data
  for each separate experiment? In this paper, we propose RoboNet, an open database
  for sharing robotic experience, which provides an initial pool of 15 million video
  frames, from 7 different robot platforms, and study how it can be used to learn
  generalizable models for vision-based robotic manipulation. We combine the dataset
  with two different learning algorithms: visual foresight, which uses forward video
  prediction models, and supervised inverse models. Our experiments test the learned
  algorithmsâ€™ ability to work across new objects, new tasks, new scenes, new camera
  viewpoints, new grippers, or even entirely new robots. In our final experiment,
  we find that by pre-training on RoboNet and fine-tuning on data from a held-out
  Franka or Kuka robot, we can exceed the performance of a robot-specific training
  approach that uses 4x-20x more data.1'
