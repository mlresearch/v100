title: A correct formulation for the Orientation Dynamic Movement Primitives for robot
  control in the Cartesian space
abstract: Dynamic movement primitives (DMP) are an efficient way for learning and
  reproducing complex robot behaviors. A singularity free DMP formulation for orientation
  in the Cartesian space is proposed by Ude et al. [1] and has been largely adopted
  by the research community. In this work, we demonstrate the undesired oscillatory
  behavior that may arise when controlling the robotâ€™s orientation with this formulation,
  producing a motion pattern highly deviant from the desired and highlight its source.
  A correct formulation is then proposed that alleviates such problems while guaranteeing
  generation of orientation parameters that lie in SO(3). We further show that all
  aspects and advantages of DMP including ease of learning, temporal and spatial scaling
  and the ability to include coupling terms are maintained in the proposed formulation.
  Simulations and experiments with robot control in SO(3) are performed to demonstrate
  the performance of the proposed formulation and compare it with the previously adopted
  one.
