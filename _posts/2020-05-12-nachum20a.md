title: Multi-Agent Manipulation via Locomotion using Hierarchical Sim2Real
abstract: Manipulation and locomotion are closely related problems that are often
  studied in isolation. In this work, we study the problem of coordinating multiple
  mobile agents to exhibit manipulation behaviors using a reinforcement learning (RL)
  approach. Our method hinges on the use of hierarchical sim2real â€“ a simulated environment
  is used to learn low-level goal-reaching skills, which are then used as the action
  space for a high-level RL controller, also trained in simulation. The full hierarchical
  policy is then transferred to the real world in a zero-shot fashion. The application
  of domain randomization during training enables the learned behaviors to generalize
  to real-world settings, while the use of hierarchy provides a modular paradigm for
  learning and transferring increasingly complex behaviors. We evaluate our method
  on a number of real-world tasks, including coordinated object manipulation in a
  multi-agent setting.
