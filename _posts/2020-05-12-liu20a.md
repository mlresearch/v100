title: 'PIC: Permutation Invariant Critic for Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning'
abstract: Sample efficiency and scalability to a large number of agents are two important
  goals for multi-agent reinforcement learning systems. Recent works got us closer
  to those goals, addressing non-stationarity of the environment from a single agent’s
  perspective by utilizing a deep net critic which depends on all observations and
  actions. The critic input concatenates agent observations and actions in a user-specified
  order. However, since deep nets aren’t permutation invariant, a permuted input changes
  the critic output despite the environment remaining identical. To avoid this inefficiency,
  we propose a ‘permutation invariant critic’ (PIC), which yields identical output
  irrespective of the agent permutation. This consistent representation enables our
  model to scale to 30 times more agents and to achieve improvements of test episode
  reward between 15% to 50% on the challenging multi-agent particle environment (MPE).
