title: Learning Navigation Subroutines from Egocentric Videos
abstract: 'Planning at a higher level of abstraction instead of low level torques
  improves the sample efficiency in reinforcement learning, and computational efficiency
  in classical planning. We propose a method to learn such hierarchical abstractions,
  or subroutines from egocentric video data of experts performing tasks. We learn
  a self-supervised inverse model on small amounts of random interaction data to pseudo-label
  the expert egocentric videos with agent actions. Visuomotor subroutines are acquired
  from these pseudo-labeled videos by learning a latent intent-conditioned policy
  that predicts the inferred pseudo-actions from the corresponding image observations.
  We demonstrate our proposed approach in context of navigation, and show that we
  can successfully learn consistent and diverse visuomotor subroutines from passive
  egocentric videos. We demonstrate the utility of our acquired visuomotor subroutines
  by using them as is for exploration, and as sub-policies in a hierarchical RL framework
  for reaching point goals and semantic goals. We also demonstrate behavior of our
  subroutines in the real world, by deploying them on a real robotic platform. Project
