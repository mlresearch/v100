title: Stochastic Optimal Control as Approximate Input Inference
abstract: Optimal control of stochastic nonlinear dynamical systems is a major challenge
  in the domain of robot learning. Given the intractability of the global control
  problem, state-of-the-art algorithms focus on approximate sequential optimization
  techniques, that heavily rely on heuristics for regularization in order to achieve
  stable convergence. By building upon the duality between inference and control,
  we develop the view of Optimal Control as Input Estimation, devising a probabilistic
  stochastic optimal control formulation that iteratively infers the optimal input
  distributions by minimizing an upper bound of the control cost. Inference is performed
  through Expectation Maximization and message passing on a probabilistic graphical
  model of the dynamical system, and time-varying linear Gaussian feedback controllers
  are extracted from the joint state-action distribution. This perspective incorporates
  uncertainty quantification, effective initialization through priors, and the principled
  regularization inherent to the Bayesian treatment. Moreover, it can be shown that
  for deterministic linearized systems, our framework derives the maximum entropy
  linear quadratic optimal control law. We provide a complete and detailed derivation
  of our probabilistic approach and highlight its advantages in comparison to other
  deterministic and probabilistic solvers.
