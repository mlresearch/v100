title: Variational Optimization Based Reinforcement Learning for Infinite Dimensional
  Stochastic Systems
abstract: Systems involving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) have recently become
  more popular among the machine learning community. However prior methods usually
  treat infinite dimensional problems in finite dimensions with Reduced Order Models.
  This leads to committing to specific approximation schemes and subsequent derivation
  of control laws. Additionally, prior work does not consider spatio-temporal descriptions
  of noise that realistically represent the stochastic nature of physical systems.
  In this paper we suggest a new reinforcement learning framework that is mostly model-free
  for Stochastic PDEs with additive spacetime noise, based on variational optimization
  in infinite dimensions. In addition, our algorithm incorporates sparse representations
  that allow for efficient learning of feedback policies in high dimensions. We demonstrate
  the efficacy of the proposed approach with several simulated experiments on a variety
  of SPDEs.
