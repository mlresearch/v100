title: 'MAT: Multi-Fingered Adaptive Tactile Grasping via Deep Reinforcement Learning'
abstract: Vision-based grasping systems typically adopt an open-loop execution of
  a planned grasp. This policy can fail due to many reasons, including ubiquitous
  calibration error. Recovery from a failed grasp is further complicated by visual
  occlusion, as the hand is usually occluding the vision sensor as it attempts another
  open-loop regrasp. This work presents MAT, a tactile closed-loop method capable
  of realizing grasps provided by a coarse initial positioning of the hand above an
  object. Our algorithm is a deep reinforcement learning (RL) policy optimized through
  the clipped surrogate objective within a maximum entropy RL framework to balance
  exploitation and exploration. The method utilizes tactile and proprioceptive information
  to act through both fine finger motions and larger regrasp movements to execute
  stable grasps. A novel curriculum of action motion magnitude makes learning more
  tractable and helps turn common failure cases into successes. Careful selection
  of features that exhibit small sim-to-real gaps enables this tactile grasping policy,
  trained purely in simulation, to transfer well to real world environments without
  the need for additional learning. Experimentally, this methodology improves over
  a vision-only grasp success rate substantially on a multi-fingered robot hand. When
  this methodology is used to realize grasps from coarse initial positions provided
  by a vision-only planner, the system is made dramatically more robust to calibration
  errors in the camera-robot transform.
