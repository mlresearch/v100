title: 'PyRoboLearn: A Python Framework for Robot Learning Practitioners'
abstract: On the quest for building autonomous robots, several robot learning frameworks
  with different functionalities have recently been developed. Yet, frameworks that
  combine diverse learning paradigms (such as imitation and reinforcement learning)
  into a common place are scarce. Existing ones tend to be robot-specific, and often
  require time-consuming work to be used with other robots. Also, their architecture
  is often weakly structured, mainly because of a lack of modularity and flexibility.
  This leads users to reimplement several pieces of code to integrate them into their
  own experimental or benchmarking work. To overcome these issues, we introduce PyRoboLearn,
  a new Python robot learning framework that combines different learning paradigms
  into a single framework. Our framework provides a plethora of robotic environments,
  learning models and algorithms. PyRoboLearn is developed with a particular focus
  on modularity, flexibility, generality, and simplicity to favor (re)usability. This
  is achieved by abstracting each key concept, undertaking a modular programming approach,
  minimizing the coupling among the different modules, and favoring composition over
  inheritance for better flexibility. We demonstrate the different features and utility
  of our framework through different use cases.
