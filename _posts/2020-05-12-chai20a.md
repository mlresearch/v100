title: 'MultiPath: Multiple Probabilistic Anchor Trajectory Hypotheses for Behavior
  Prediction'
abstract: Predicting human behavior is a difficult and crucial task required for motion
  planning. It is challenging in large part due to the highly uncertain and multimodal
  set of possible outcomes in real-world domains such as autonomous driving. Beyond
  single MAP trajectory prediction [1, 2], obtaining an accurate probability distribution
  of the future is an area of active interest [3, 4]. We present MultiPath, which
  leverages a fixed set of future state-sequence anchors that correspond to modes
  of the trajectory distribution. At inference, our model predicts a discrete distribution
  over the anchors and, for each anchor, regresses offsets from anchor waypoints along
  with uncertainties, yielding a Gaussian mixture at each time step. Our model is
  efficient, requiring only one forward inference pass to obtain multi-modal future
  distributions, and the output is parametric, allowing compact communication and
  analytical probabilistic queries. We show on several datasets that our model achieves
  more accurate predictions, and compared to sampling baselines, does so with an order
  of magnitude fewer trajectories.
