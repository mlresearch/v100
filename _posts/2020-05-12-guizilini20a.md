title: Robust Semi-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation with Reprojected Distances
abstract: Dense depth estimation from a single image is a key problem in computer
  vision, with exciting applications in a multitude of robotic tasks. Initially viewed
  as a direct regression problem, requiring annotated labels as supervision at training
  time, in the past few years a substantial amount of work has been done in self-supervised
  depth training based on strong geometric cues, both from stereo cameras and more
  recently from monocular video sequences. In this paper we investigate how these
  two approaches (supervised & self-supervised) can be effectively combined, so that
  a depth model can learn to encode true scale from sparse supervision while achieving
  high fidelity local accuracy by leveraging geometric cues. To this end, we propose
  a novel supervised loss term that complements the widely used photometric loss,
  and show how it can be used to train robust semi-supervised monocular depth estimation
  models. Furthermore, we evaluate how much supervision is actually necessary to train
  accurate scale-aware monocular depth models, showing that with our proposed framework,
  very sparse LiDAR information, with as few as 4 beams (less than 100 valid depth
  values per image), is enough to achieve results competitive with the current state-of-the-art.
