title: 'Curious iLQR: Resolving Uncertainty in Model-based RL'
abstract: Curiosity as a means to explore during reinforcement learning problems has
  recently become very popular. However, very little progress has been made in utilizing
  curiosity for learning control. In this work, we propose a model-based reinforcement
  learning (MBRL) framework that combines Bayesian modeling of the system dynamics
  with curious iLQR , an iterative LQR approach that considers model uncertainty.
  During trajectory optimization the curious iLQR attempts to minimize both the task-dependent
  cost and the uncertainty in the dynamics model. We demonstrate the approach on reaching
  tasks with 7-DoF manipulators in simulation and on a real robot. Our experiments
  show that MBRL with curious iLQR reaches desired end-effector targets more reliably
  and with less system rollouts when learning a new task from scratch, and that the
  learned model generalizes better to new reaching tasks.
