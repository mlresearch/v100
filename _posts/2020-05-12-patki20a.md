title: Language-guided Semantic Mapping and Mobile Manipulation in Partially Observable
  Environments
abstract: Recent advances in data-driven models for grounded language understanding
  have enabled robots to interpret increasingly complex instructions. Two fundamental
  limitations of these methods are that most require a full model of the environment
  to be known a priori, and they attempt to reason over a world representation that
  is flat and unnecessarily detailed, which limits scalability. Recent semantic mapping
  methods address partial observability by exploiting language as a sensor to infer
  a distribution over topological, metric and semantic properties of the environment.
  However, maintaining a distribution over highly detailed maps that can support grounding
  of diverse instructions is computationally expensive and hinders real-time human-robot
  collaboration. We propose a novel framework that learns to adapt perception according
  to the task in order to maintain compact distributions over semantic maps. Experiments
  with a mobile manipulator demonstrate more efficient instruction following in a
  priori unknown environments.
