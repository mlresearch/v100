title: 'Navigation Agents for the Visually Impaired: A Sidewalk Simulator and Experiments'
abstract: Millions of blind and visually-impaired (BVI) people navigate urban environments
  everyday, using smartphones for high-level path-planning and white canes or guide
  dogs for local information. However, many BVI people still struggle to travel to
  new places. In our endeavour to create a navigation assistant for the BVI, we found
  that existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments were unsuitable for the task.
  This work introduces SEVN, a sidewalk simulation environment and a neural network-based
  approach to creating a navigation agent. SEVN contains panoramic images with labels
  for house numbers, doors, and street name signs, and formulations for several navigation
  tasks. We study the performance of an RL algorithm (PPO) in this setting. Our policy
  model fuses multi-modal observations in the form of variable resolution images,
  visible text, and simulated GPS data to navigate to a goal door. We hope that this
  dataset, simulator, and experimental results will provide a foundation for further
  research into the creation of agents that can assist members of the BVI community
  with outdoor navigation.
