title: 'HRL4IN: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Interactive Navigation with
  Mobile Manipulators'
abstract: 'Most common navigation tasks in human environments require auxiliary arm
  interactions, e.g. opening doors, pressing buttons and pushing obstacles away. This
  type of navigation tasks, which we call Interactive Navigation, requires the use
  of mobile manipulators: mobile bases with manipulation capabilities. Interactive
  Navigation tasks are usually long-horizon and composed of heterogeneous phases of
  pure navigation, pure manipulation, and their combination. Using the wrong part
  of the embodiment is inefficient and hinders progress. We propose HRL4IN, a novel
  Hierarchical RL architecture for Interactive Navigation tasks. HRL4IN exploits the
  exploration benefits of HRL over flat RL for long-horizon tasks thanks to temporally
  extended commitments towards subgoals. Different from other HRL solutions, HRL4IN
  handles the heterogeneous nature of the Interactive Navigation task by creating
  subgoals in different spaces in different phases of the task. Moreover, HRL4IN selects
  different parts of the embodiment to use for each phase, improving energy efficiency.
  We evaluate HRL4IN against flat PPO and HAC, a state-of-the-art HRL algorithm, on
  Interactive Navigation in two environments - a 2D grid-world environment and a 3D
  environment with physics simulation. We show that HRL4IN significantly outperforms
  its baselines in terms of task performance and energy efficiency. More information
