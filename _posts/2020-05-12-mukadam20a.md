title: Riemannian Motion Policy Fusion through Learnable Lyapunov Function Reshaping
abstract: 'RMPflow is a recently proposed policy-fusion framework based on differential
  geometry. While RMPflow has demonstrated promising performance, it requires the
  user to provide sensible subtask policies as Riemannian motion policies (RMPs: a
  motion policy and an importance matrix function), which can be a difficult design
  problem in its own right. We propose RMPfusion, a variation of RMPflow, to address
  this issue. RMPfusion supplements RMPflow with weight functions that can hierarchically
  reshape the Lyapunov functions of the subtask RMPs according to the current configuration
  of the robot and environment. This extra flexibility can remedy imperfect subtask
  RMPs provided by the user, improving the combined policyâ€™s performance. These weight
  functions can be learned by back-propagation. Moreover, we prove that, under mild
  restrictions on the weight functions, RMPfusion always yields a globally Lyapunov-stable
  motion policy. This implies that we can treat RMPfusion as a structured policy class
  in policy optimization that is guaranteed to generate stable policies, even during
  the immature phase of learning. We demonstrate these properties of RMPfusion in
  imitation learning experiments both in simulation and on a real-world robot.'
