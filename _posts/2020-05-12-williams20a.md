title: Locally Weighted Regression Pseudo-Rehearsal for Adaptive Model Predictive
  Control
abstract: We consider the problem of online adaptation of a neural network designed
  to represent system dynamics. The neural network model is intended to be used by
  an MPC control law for autonomous control. This problem is challenging because both
  input and target distributions are non-stationary, and naive approaches to online
  adaptation result in catastrophic forgetting. We present a novel online learning
  method, which combines the pseudo-rehearsal method with locally weighted projection
  regression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting Locally Weighted Projection
  Regression Pseudo-Rehearsal (LW-PR2) method on an autonomous vehicle in simulation
  and real world data collected with a 1/5 scale autonomous vehicle.
