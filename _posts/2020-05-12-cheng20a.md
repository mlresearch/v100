title: Trajectory-wise Control Variates for Variance Reduction in Policy Gradient
  Methods
abstract: 'Policy gradient methods have demonstrated success in reinforcement learning
  tasks with high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces. But they are also
  notoriously sample inefficient, which can be attributed, at least in part, to the
  high variance in estimating the gradient of the task objective with Monte Carlo
  methods. Previous research has endeavored to contend with this problem by studying
  control variates (CVs) that can reduce the variance of estimates without introducing
  bias, including the early use of baselines, state dependent CVs, and the more recent
  state-action dependent CVs. In this work, we analyze the properties and drawbacks
  of previous CV techniques and, surprisingly, we find that these works have overlooked
  an important fact that Monte Carlo gradient estimates are generated by trajectories
  of states and actions. We show that ignoring the correlation across the trajectories
  can result in suboptimal variance reduction, and we propose a simple fix: a class
  of trajectory-wise CVs, that can further drive down the variance. The trajectory-wise
  CVs can be computed recursively and require only learning state-action value functions
  like the previous CVs for policy gradient. We further prove that the proposed trajectory-wise
  CVs are optimal for variance reduction under reasonable assumptions.'
