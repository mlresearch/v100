title: An Online Learning Procedure for Feedback Linearization Control without Torque
  Measurements
abstract: By exploiting an a-priori estimate of the dynamic model of a manipulator,
  it is possible to command joint torques which ideally realize a Feedback Linearization
  (FL) controller. The exact cancellation may nevertheless not be achieved due to
  model uncertainties and possible errors in the estimation of the dynamic coefficients.
  In this work, an online learning scheme for control based on FL is presented. By
  reading joint positions and joint velocities information only (without the use of
  any torque measurement), we are able to learn those model uncertainties and thus
  achieve perfect FL control. Simulations results on the popular KUKA LWR iiwa robot
  are reported to show the quality of the proposed approach.
