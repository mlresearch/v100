title: Counter-example Guided Learning of Bounds on Environment Behavior
abstract: 'There is a growing interest in building autonomous systems that interact
  with complex environments. The difficulty associated with obtaining an accurate
  model for such environments poses a challenge to the task of assessing and guaranteeing
  the system’s performance. We present a data-driven solution that allows for a system
  to be evaluated for specification conformance without an accurate model of the environment.
  Our approach involves learning a conservative reactive bound of the environment’s
  behavior using data and specification of the system’s desired behavior. First, the
  approach begins by learning a conservative reactive bound on the environment’s actions
  that captures its possible behaviors with high probability. This bound is then used
  to assist verification, and if the verification fails under this bound, the algorithm
  returns counter-examples to show how failure occurs and then uses these to refine
  the bound. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach through two case-studies:
  i) verifying controllers for a toy multi-robot system, and ii) verifying an instance
  of human-robot interaction during a lane-change maneuver given real-world human
  driving data.'
