title: 'AC-Teach: A Bayesian Actor-Critic Method for Policy Learning with an Ensemble
  of Suboptimal Teachers'
abstract: The exploration mechanism used by a Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent
  plays a key role in determining its sample efficiency. Thus, improving over random
  exploration is crucial to solve long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards. We propose
  to leverage an ensemble of partial solutions as teachers that guide the agent’s
  exploration with action suggestions throughout training. While the setup of learning
  with teachers has been previously studied, our proposed approach – Actor-Critic
  with Teacher Ensembles (AC-Teach) – is the first to work with an ensemble of suboptimal
  teachers that may solve only part of the problem or contradict other each other,
  forming a unified algorithmic solution that is compatible with a broad range of
  teacher ensembles. AC-Teach leverages a probabilistic representation of the expected
  outcome of the teachers’ and student’s actions to direct exploration, reduce dithering,
  and adapt to the dynamically changing quality of the learner. We evaluate a variant
  of AC-Teach that guides the learning of a Bayesian DDPG agent on three tasks – path
  following, robotic pick and place, and robotic cube sweeping using a hook – and
  show that it improves largely on sampling efficiency over a set of baselines, both
  for our target scenario of unconstrained suboptimal teachers and for easier setups
  with optimal or single teachers. Additional results and videos at https://sites.google.com/view/acteach/.
