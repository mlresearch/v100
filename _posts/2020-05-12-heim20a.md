title: A Learnable Safety Measure
abstract: Failures are challenging for learning to control physical systems since
  they risk damage, time-consuming resets, and often provide little gradient information.
  Adding safety constraints to exploration typically requires a lot of prior knowledge
  and domain expertise. We present a safety measure which implicitly captures how
  the system dynamics relate to a set of failure states. Not only can this measure
  be used as a safety function, but also to directly compute the set of safe state-action
  pairs. Further, we show a model-free approach to learn this measure by active sampling
  using Gaussian processes. While safety can only be guaranteed after learning the
  safety measure, we show that failures can already be greatly reduced by using the
  estimated measure during learning.
