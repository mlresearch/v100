title: Certified Adversarial Robustness for Deep Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Deep Neural Network-based systems are now the state-of-the-art in many robotics
  tasks, but their application in safety-critical domains remains dangerous without
  formal guarantees on network robustness. Small perturbations to sensor inputs (from
  noise or adversarial examples) are often enough to change network-based decisions,
  which was already shown to cause an autonomous vehicle to swerve into oncoming traffic.
  In light of these dangers, numerous algorithms have been developed as defensive
  mechanisms from these adversarial inputs, some of which provide formal robustness
  guarantees or certificates. This work leverages research on certified adversarial
  robustness to develop an online certified defense for deep reinforcement learning
  algorithms. The proposed defense computes guaranteed lower bounds on state-action
  values during execution to identify and choose the optimal action under a worst-case
  deviation in input space due to possible adversaries or noise. The approach is demonstrated
  on a Deep Q-Network policy and is shown to increase robustness to noise and adversaries
  in pedestrian collision avoidance scenarios and a classic control task.
