title: Bayesian Optimization in Variational Latent Spaces with Dynamic Compression
abstract: Data-efficiency is crucial for autonomous robots to adapt to new tasks and
  environments. In this work, we focus on robotics problems with a budget of only
  10-20 trials. This is a very challenging setting even for data- efficient approaches
  like Bayesian optimization (BO), especially when optimizing higher-dimensional controllers.
  Previous work extracted expert-designed low-dimensional features from simulation
  trajectories to construct informed kernels and run ultra sample-efficient BO on
  hardware. We remove the need for expert-designed features by proposing a model and
  architecture for a sequential variational autoencoder that embeds the space of simulated
  trajectories into a lower-dimensional space of latent paths in an unsupervised way.
  We further compress the search space for BO by reducing exploration in parts of
  the state space that are undesirable, without requiring explicit constraints on
  controller parameters. We validate our approach with hardware experiments on a Daisy
  hexapod robot and an ABB Yumi manipulator. We also present simulation experiments
  with further comparisons to several baselines on Daisy and two manipulators. Our
  experiments indicate the proposed trajectory-based kernel with dynamic compression
  can offer ultra data-efficient optimization.
