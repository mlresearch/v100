title: Continuous-Discrete Reinforcement Learning for Hybrid Control in Robotics
abstract: Many real-world control problems involve both discrete decision variables
  – such as the choice of control modes, gear switching or digital outputs – as well
  as continuous decision variables – such as velocity setpoints, control gains or
  analogue outputs. However, when defining the corresponding optimal control or reinforcement
  learning problem, it is commonly approximated with fully continuous or fully discrete
  action spaces. These simplifications aim at tailoring the problem to a particular
  algorithm or solver which may only support one type of action space. Alternatively,
  expert heuristics are used to remove discrete actions from an otherwise continuous
  space. In contrast, we propose to treat hybrid problems in their ‘native’ form by
  solving them with hybrid reinforcement learning, which optimizes for discrete and
  continuous actions simultaneously. In our experiments, we first demonstrate that
  the proposed approach efficiently solves such natively hybrid reinforcement learning
  problems. We then show, both in simulation and on robotic hardware, the benefits
  of removing possibly imperfect expert-designed heuristics. Lastly, hybrid reinforcement
  learning encourages us to rethink problem definitions. We propose reformulating
  control problems, e.g. by adding meta actions, to improve exploration or reduce
  mechanical wear and tear.
