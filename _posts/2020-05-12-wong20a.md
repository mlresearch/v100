title: Identifying Unknown Instances for Autonomous Driving
abstract: In the past few years, we have seen great progress in perception algorithms,
  particular through the use of deep learning. However, most existing approaches focus
  on a few categories of interest, which represent only a small fraction of the potential
  categories that robots need to handle in the real-world. Thus, identifying objects
  from unknown classes remains a challenging yet crucial task. In this paper, we develop
  a novel open-set instance segmentation algorithm for point clouds which can segment
  objects from both known and unknown classes in a holistic way. Our method uses a
  deep convolutional neural network to project points into a category-agnostic embedding
  space in which they can be clustered into instances irrespective of their semantics.
  Experiments on two large-scale self-driving datasets validate the effectiveness
  of our proposed method.
