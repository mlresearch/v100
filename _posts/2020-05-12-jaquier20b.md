title: Learning from demonstration with model-based Gaussian process
abstract: In learning from demonstrations, it is often desirable to adapt the behavior
  of the robot as a function of the variability retrieved from human demonstrations
  and the (un)certainty encoded in different parts of the task. In this paper, we
  propose a novel multi-output Gaussian process (MOGP) based on Gaussian mixture regression
  (GMR). The proposed approach encapsulates the variability retrieved from the demonstrations
  in the covariance of the MOGP. Leveraging the generative nature of GP models, our
  approach can efficiently modulate trajectories towards new start-, via- or end-points
  defined by the task. Our framework allows the robot to precisely track via-points
  while being compliant in regions of high variability. We illustrate the proposed
  approach in simulated examples and validate it in a real-robot experiment.
