title: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Step Generative Models
abstract: We consider model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) in 2-agent, high-fidelity
  continuous control problems â€“ an important domain for robots inter-acting with other
  agents in the same workspace. For non-trivial dynamical systems, MBRL typically
  suffers from accumulating errors. Several recent studies have addressed this problem
  by learning latent variable models for trajectory segments and optimizing over behavior
  in the latent space. In this work, we investigate whether this approach can be extended
  to 2-agent competitive and cooperative settings. The fundamental challenge is how
  to learn models that capture interactions between agents, yet are disentangled to
  allow for optimization of each agent behavior separately. We propose such models
  based on a disentangled variational auto-encoder, and demonstrate our approach on
  a simulated 2-robot manipulation task, where one robot can either help or distract
  the other. We show that our approach has better sample efficiency than a strong
  model-free RL baseline, and can learn both cooperative and adversarial behavior
  from the same data.
