title: Energy-efficient Path Planning for Ground Robots by and Combining Air and Ground
  Measurements
abstract: 'As mobile robots find increasing use in outdoor applications, designing
  energy-efficient robot navigation algorithms is gaining importance. There are two
  primary approaches to energy efficient navigation: Offline approaches rely on a
  previously built energy map as input to a path planner. Obtaining energy maps for
  large environments is challenging. Alternatively, the robot can navigate in an online
  fashion and build the map as it navigates. Online navigation in unknown environments
  with only local information is still a challenging research problem. In this paper,
  we present a novel approach which addresses both of these challenges. Our approach
  starts with a segmented aerial image of the environment. We show that a coarse energy
  map can be built from the segmentation. However, the absolute energy value for a
  specific terrain type (e.g. grass) can vary across environments. Therefore, rather
  than using this energy map directly, we use it to build the covariance function
  for a Gaussian Process (GP) based representation of the environment. In the online
  phase, energy measurements collected during navigation are used for estimating energy
  profiles across the environment using GP regression. Coupled with an Aâ‹†-like navigation
  algorithm, we show in simulations that our approach outperforms representative baseline
  approaches. We also present results from field experiments which demonstrate the
  practical applicability of our method.'
