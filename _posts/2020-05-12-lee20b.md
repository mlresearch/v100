title: Perceptual Attention-based Predictive Control
abstract: In this paper, we present a novel information processing architecture for
  safe deep learning-based visual navigation of autonomous systems. The proposed information
  processing architecture is used to support a perceptual attention-based predictive
  control algorithm that leverages model predictive control (MPC), convolutional neural
  networks (CNNs), and uncertainty quantification methods. The novelty of our approach
  lies in using MPC to learn how to place attention on relevant areas of the visual
  input, which ultimately allows the system to more rapidly detect unsafe conditions.
  We accomplish this by using MPC to learn to select regions of interest in the input
  image, which are used to output control actions as well as estimates of epistemic
  and aleatoric uncertainty in the attention-aware visual input. We use these uncertainty
  estimates to quantify the safety of our network controller under the current navigation
  condition. The proposed architecture and algorithm is tested on a 1:5 scale terrestrial
  vehicle. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms previous
  approaches on early detection of unsafe conditions, such as when novel obstacles
  are present in the navigation environment. The proposed architecture is the first
  step towards using deep learning-based perceptual control policies in safety-critical
  domains.
