title: Learning to Manipulate Object Collections Using Grounded State Representations
abstract: 'We propose a method for sim-to-real robot learning which exploits simulator
  state information in a way that scales to many objects. First, we train a pair of
  encoders on raw object pose targets to learn representations that accurately capture
  the state information of a multi-object environment. Second, we use these encoders
  in a reinforcement learning algorithm to train image-based policies capable of manipulating
  many objects. Our pair of encoders consists of one which consumes RGB images and
  is used in our policy network, and one which directly consumes a set of raw object
  poses and is used for reward calculation and value estimation. We evaluate our method
  on the task of pushing a collection of objects to desired tabletop regions. Compared
  to methods which rely only on images or use fixed-length state encodings, our method
  achieves higher success rates, performs well in the real world without fine tuning,
  and generalizes to different numbers and types of objects not seen during training.
