title: Entity Abstraction in Visual Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
abstract: We present OP3, a framework for model-based reinforcement learning that
  acquires object representations from raw visual observations without supervision
  and uses them to predict and plan. To ground these abstract representations of entities
  to actual objects in the world, we formulate an interactive inference algorithm
  which incorporates dynamic information in the scene. Our model can handle a variable
  number of entities by symmetrically processing each object representation with the
  same locally-scoped function. On block-stacking tasks, OP3 can generalize to novel
  block configurations and more objects than seen during training, outperforming both
  a model that assumes access to object supervision and a state-of-the-art video prediction
  model.
