title: Learning Reactive Motion Policies in Multiple Task Spaces from Human Demonstrations
abstract: Complex manipulation tasks often require non-trivial and coordinated movements
  of different parts of a robot. In this work, we address the challenges associated
  with learning and reproducing the skills required to execute such complex tasks.
  Specifically, we decompose a task into multiple subtasks and learn to reproduce
  the subtasks by learning stable policies from demonstrations. By leveraging the
  RMPflow framework for motion generation, our approach finds a stable global policy
  in the configuration space that enables simultaneous execution of various learned
  subtasks. The resulting global policy is a weighted combination of the learned policies
  such that the motions are coordinated and feasible under the robotâ€™s kinematic and
  environmental constraints. We demonstrate the necessity and efficacy of the proposed
  approach in the context of multiple constrained manipulation tasks performed by
  a Franka Emika robot.
