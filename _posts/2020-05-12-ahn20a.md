title: 'ROBEL: Robotics Benchmarks for Learning with Low-Cost Robots'
abstract: 'ROBEL is an open-source platform of cost-effective robots designed for
  reinforcement learning in the real world. ROBEL introduces two robots, each aimed
  to accelerate reinforcement learning research in different task domains: D’Claw
  is a three-fingered hand robot that facilitates learning dexterous manipulation
  tasks, and D’Kitty is a four-legged robot that facilitates learning agile legged
  locomotion tasks. These low-cost, modular robots are easy to maintain and are robust
  enough to sustain on-hardware reinforcement learning from scratch with over 14000
  training hours registered on them to date. To leverage this platform, we propose
  an extensible set of continuous control benchmark tasks for each robot. These tasks
  feature dense and sparse task objectives, and additionally introduce score metrics
  for hardware-safety. We provide benchmark scores on an initial set of tasks using
  a variety of learning-based methods. Furthermore, we show that these results can
  be replicated across copies of the robots located in different institutions. Code,
  documentation, design files, detailed assembly instructions, trained policies, baseline
  details, task videos, and all supplementary materials required to reproduce the
  results are available at www.roboticsbenchmarks.org.'
