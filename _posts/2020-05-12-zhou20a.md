title: End-to-End Multi-View Fusion for 3D Object Detection in LiDAR Point Clouds
abstract: Recent work on 3D object detection advocates point cloud voxelization in
  birds-eye view, where objects preserve their physical dimensions and are naturally
  separable. When represented in this view, however, point clouds are sparse and have
  highly variable point density, which may cause detectors difficulties in detecting
  distant or small objects (pedestrians, traffic signs, etc.). On the other hand,
  perspective view provides dense observations, which could allow more favorable feature
  encoding for such cases. In this paper, we aim to synergize the birds-eye view and
  the perspective view and propose a novel end-to-end multiview fusion (MVF) algorithm,
  which can effectively learn to utilize the complementary information from both.
  Specifically, we introduce dynamic voxelization, which has four merits compared
  to existing voxelization methods, i) removing the need of pre-allocating a tensor
  with fixed size; ii) overcoming the information loss due to stochastic point/voxel
  dropout; iii) yielding deterministic voxel embeddings and more stable detection
  outcomes; iv) establishing the bi-directional relationship between points and voxels,
  which potentially lays a natural foundation for cross-view feature fusion. By employing
  dynamic voxelization, the proposed feature fusion architecture enables each point
  to learn to fuse context information from different views. MVF operates on points
  and can be naturally extended to other approaches using LiDAR point clouds. We evaluate
  our MVF model extensively on the newly released Waymo Open Dataset and on the KITTI
  dataset and demonstrate that it significantly improves detection accuracy over the
  comparable single-view PointPillars baseline.
