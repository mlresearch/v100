title: 'TuneNet: One-Shot Residual Tuning for System Identification and Sim-to-Real
  Robot Task Transfer'
abstract: As researchers teach robots to perform more and more complex tasks, the
  need for realistic simulation environments is growing. Existing techniques for closing
  the reality gap by approximating real-world physics often require extensive real
  world data and/or thousands of simulation samples. This paper presents TuneNet,
  a new machine learning-based method to directly tune the parameters of one model
  to match another using an iterative residual tuning technique. TuneNet estimates
  the parameter difference between two models using a single observation from the
  target and minimal simulation, allowing rapid, accurate and sample-efficient parameter
  estimation. The system can be trained via supervised learning over an auto-generated
  simulated dataset. We show that TuneNet can perform system identification even when
  the true parameter values lie well outside the distribution seen during training,
  and demonstrate that simulators tuned with TuneNet outperform existing techniques
  for predicting rigid body motion. Finally, we show that our method can estimate
  real-world parameter values, allowing a robot to perform sim-to-real task transfer
  on a dynamic manipulation task unseen during training. Code and videos are available
