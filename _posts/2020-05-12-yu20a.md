title: 'Meta-World: A Benchmark and Evaluation for Multi-Task and Meta Reinforcement
  Learning'
abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning algorithms can enable robots to acquire new
  skills much more quickly, by leveraging prior experience to learn how to learn.
  However, much of the current research on meta-reinforcement learning focuses on
  task distributions that are very narrow. For example, a commonly used meta-reinforcement
  learning benchmark uses different running velocities for a simulated robot as different
  tasks. When policies are meta-trained on such narrow task distributions, they cannot
  possibly generalize to more quickly acquire entirely new tasks. Therefore, if the
  aim of these methods is enable faster acquisition of entirely new behaviors, we
  must evaluate them on task distributions that are sufficiently broad to enable generalization
  to new behaviors. In this paper, we propose an open-source simulated benchmark for
  meta-reinforcement learning and multitask learning consisting of 50 distinct robotic
  manipulation tasks. Our aim is to make it possible to develop algorithms that generalize
  to accelerate the acquisition of entirely new, held-out tasks. We evaluate 6 state-of-the-art
  meta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning algorithms on these tasks. Surprisingly,
  while each task and its variations (e.g., with different object positions) can be
  learned with reasonable success, these algorithms struggle to learn with multiple
  tasks at the same time, even with as few as ten distinct training tasks. Our analysis
  and open-source environments pave the way for future research in multi-task learning
  and meta-learning that can enable meaningful generalization, thereby unlocking the
  full potential of these methods.1.
