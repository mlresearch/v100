title: Inferring Task Goals and Constraints using Bayesian Nonparametric Inverse Reinforcement
  Learning
abstract: Recovering an unknown reward function for complex manipulation tasks is
  the fundamental problem of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). Often, the recovered
  reward function fails to explicitly capture implicit constraints (e.g., axis alignment,
  force, or relative alignment) between the manipulator, the objects of interaction,
  and other entities in the workspace. The standard IRL approaches do not model the
  presence of locally-consistent constraints that may be active only in a section
  of a demonstration. This work introduces Constraint-based Bayesian Nonparametric
  Inverse Reinforcement Learning (CBN-IRL) that models the observed behaviour as a
  sequence of subtasks, each consisting of a goal and a set of locally-active constraints.
  CBN-IRL infers locally-active constraints given a single demonstration by identifying
  potential constraints and their activation space. Further, the nonparametric prior
  over subgoals constituting the task allows the model to adapt with the complexity
  of the demonstration. The inferred set of goals and constraints are then used to
  recover a control policy via constrained optimization. We evaluate the proposed
  model in simulated navigation and manipulation domains. CBN-IRL efficiently learns
  a compact representation for complex tasks that allows generalization in novel environments,
  outperforming state-of-the-art IRL methods. Finally, we demonstrate the model on
  two tool-manipulation tasks using a UR5 manipulator and show generalization to novel
  test scenarios.
