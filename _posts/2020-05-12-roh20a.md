title: Conditional Driving from Natural Language Instructions
abstract: Widespread adoption of self-driving cars will depend not only on their safety
  but largely on their ability to interact with human users. Just like human drivers,
  self-driving cars will be expected to understand and safely follow natural-language
  directions that suddenly alter the pre-planned route according to userâ€™s preference
  or in presence of ambiguities, particularly in locations with poor or outdated map
  coverage. To this end, we propose a language-grounded driving agent implementing
  a hierarchical policy using recurrent layers and gated attention. The hierarchical
  approach enables us to reason both in terms of high-level language instructions
  describing long time horizons and low-level, complex, continuous state/action spaces
  required for real-time control of a self-driving car. We train our policy with conditional
  imitation learning from realistic language data collected from human drivers and
  navigators. Through quantitative and interactive experiments within the CARLA framework,
  we show that our model can successfully interpret language instructions and follow
  them safely, even when generalizing to previously unseen environments. Code and
