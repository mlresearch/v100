title: Learning to Navigate Using Mid-Level Visual Priors
abstract: How much does having visual priors about the world (e.g. the fact that the
  world is 3D) assist in learning to perform downstream motor tasks (e.g. navigating
  a complex environment)? What are the consequences of not utilizing such visual priors
  in learning? We study these questions by integrating a generic perceptual skill
  set (a distance estimator, an edge detector, etc.) within a reinforcement learning
  framework (see Fig. 1). This skill set (“mid-level vision”) provides the policy
  with a more processed state of the world compared to raw images. Our large-scale
  study demonstrates that using mid-level vision results in policies that learn faster,
  generalize better, and achieve higher final performance, when compared to learning
  from scratch and/or using state-of-the-art visual and non-visual representation
  learning methods. We show that conventional computer vision objectives are particularly
  effective in this regard and can be conveniently integrated into reinforcement learning
  frameworks. Finally, we found that no single visual representation was universally
  useful for all downstream tasks, hence we computationally derive a task-agnostic
  set of representations optimized to support arbitrary downstream tasks.
