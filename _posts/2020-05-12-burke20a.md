title: Hybrid system identification using switching density networks
abstract: Behaviour cloning is a commonly used strategy for imitation learning and
  can be extremely effective in constrained domains. However, in cases where the dynamics
  of an environment may be state dependent and varying, behaviour cloning places a
  burden on model capacity and the number of demonstrations required.This paper introduces
  switching density networks, which rely on a categorical reparametrisation for hybrid
  system identification. This results in a network comprising a classification layer
  that is followed by a regression layer. We use switching density networks to predict
  the parameters of hybrid control laws, which are toggled by a switching layer to
  produce different controller outputs, when conditioned on an input state. This work
  shows how switching density networks can be used for hybrid system identification
  in a variety of tasks, successfully identifying the key joint angle goals that make
  up manipulation tasks, while simultaneously learning image-based goal classifiers
  and regression networks that predict joint angles from images. We also show that
  they can cluster the phase space of an inverted pendulum, identifying the balance,
  spin and pump controllers required to solve this task. Switching density networks
  can be difficult to train, but we introduce a cross entropy regularisation loss
  that stabilises training.
