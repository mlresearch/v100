title: A Survey on Reproducibility by Evaluating Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
  on Real-World Robots
abstract: As reinforcement learning (RL) achieves more success in solving complex
  tasks, more care is needed to ensure that RL research is reproducible and that algorithms
  therein can be compared easily and fairly with minimal bias. RL results are, however,
  notoriously hard to reproduce due to the algorithms’ intrinsic variance, the environments’
  stochasticity, and numerous (potentially unreported) hyper-parameters. In this work
  we investigate the many issues leading to irreproducible research and how to manage
  those. We further show how to utilise a rigorous and standardised evaluation approach
  for easing the process of documentation, evaluation and fair comparison of different
  algorithms, where we emphasise the importance of choosing the right measurement
  metrics and conducting proper statistics on the results, for unbiased reporting
  of the results.
